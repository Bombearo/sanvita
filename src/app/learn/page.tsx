            {segment:"Needle Body",
            content:"Manufactured using high-grade austenitic stainless steel, the needle body is precisely alloyed for optimal hardness and flexibility. The surface is polished to a smooth, burr-free finish to ensure excellent control and greater patient comfort."

        question:"What kind of processing is typically applied to acupuncture needles on the market?",
        answer:[
            {segment:"Handle",
                content:"Copper handles are passivated to prevent oxidation and discolouration"
            },
            {segment:"Needle Body",
            content:"Stainless steel needle bodies are coated with cured silicone oil to improve insertion smoothness while maintaining a burr-free surface."
            },
            {segment:"Needle Tip",
                content:"Blunt pine-shaped tips often cause more pain on insertion and are rarely used by quality brands. Awn-shaped (lancet-style) tips offer moderate resistance and low discomfort, while ultra-awn-shaped tips are extremely fine and require minimal insertion pressure â€” but may cause stinging sensations if poorly manufactured."
